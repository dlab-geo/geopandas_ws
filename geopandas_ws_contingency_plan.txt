1.) Navigate browser to  notebooks.azure.com

2.) Use your Berkeley address to log in

3.) You will be redirected to a Berkeley site, where you can complete login

4.) Click "Open in Jupyter", toward the top-right of the screen.

5.) Select "Upload", navigate to your repo, select the .ipynb file, then "Upload" it.

6.) Launch that notebook.

7.) Run the first section of code, which should wget and unzip the repo (again, to get at the data), and
successfully install geopy and geopandas.

8.) We should then be able to run through the rest of our workshop, save for a few sections! :)
